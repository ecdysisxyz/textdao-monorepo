# TextDAO Specification

This document provides a detailed specification of the TextDAO contract, which represents an individual decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) instance within the TextDAO ecosystem.

## Overview

The TextDAO contract manages the core functionality of a TextDAO focused on collaborative text creation and management. It implements a deliberation process, including proposal management, voting, text operations, and member governance.

## Key Features

### Deliberation Process

1. Proposal Creation
    - A member proposes a new proposal with header metadata and actions
    - Representatives are randomly selected using VRF
2. Fork Creation
    - Selected representatives fork (add header or command) for the proposal
3. Vote & Tally System (Ranked Choice Voting)
    - Selected representatives vote on the proposal
        - Uses a ranked choice voting system
        - Representatives rank their choices for both headers and commands
        - Votes are weighted based on the ranking (Borda Rule)
    - After the expiry duration, the proposal is tallied
4. Approved Action Execution Mechanism
    - If approved, the proposal's actions are executed

### Executable Action Types

1. Text Management
    - Texts are stored with associated metadata CIDs
    - Proposals can include actions to create, update, or delete texts

2. Member Management
    - Members can join the DAO through a proposal or direct invitation
    - Each member has associated member info (IPFS CID)

3. Configuration Management

## Contract Structures

### Storage

- [Schema.sol](../../src/textdao/storages/Schema.sol)
- [Storage.sol](../../src/textdao/storages/Storage.sol)

### Functions

[TextDAOFunctions.sol](../../src/textdao/interfaces/TextDAOFunctions.sol)

1. Propose
2. Fork
3. Vote
4. Tally
5. Execute

### Errors

- [TextDAOErrors.sol](../../src/textdao/interfaces/TextDAOErrors.sol)

### Events

- [TextDAOEvents.sol](../../src/textdao/interfaces/TextDAOEvents.sol)

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control: Ensure only authorized addresses can perform sensitive operations
2. VRF Integration: Secure implementation of Chainlink VRF for representative selection
3. Proposal Execution: Validate and sanitize inputs for proposal actions before execution
4. Upgradeability: Implement secure upgrade mechanisms for contract updates

## Future Considerations

1. Enhanced Governance Models: Support for more complex governance structures and voting mechanisms.
2. Implement cross-DAO collaboration features
3. Enhance the text management system with version control and collaborative editing features

## Conclusion

The TextDAO contract serves as the core component for individual DAO instances within the TextDAO ecosystem. By leveraging the UCS architecture and implementing robust governance mechanisms, it provides a flexible and secure foundation for decentralized text management and collaborative decision-making.
