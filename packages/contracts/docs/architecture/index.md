# TextDAO Contracts Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the TextDAO smart contract architecture, outlining the key components and their relationships.

## System Components

The TextDAO contract ecosystem consists of the following main components:

1. HubDAO
2. TextDAO

### HubDAO

The HubDAO contract serves as the central hub for managing multiple TextDAO instances. It is responsible for:

- Creating new TextDAO instances
- Managing the registry of TextDAO contracts
- Handling global configurations and upgrades

For detailed information about the HubDAO contract, refer to the [HubDAO Specification](hubdao-spec.md).

### TextDAO

The TextDAO contract represents an individual DAO instance. Each TextDAO is responsible for:

- Managing proposals and forks, texts, members and deliberation configs
- Handling text creation and modifications
- Implementing governance rules specific to the DAO

For a comprehensive overview of the TextDAO contract, see the [TextDAO Specification](textdao-spec.md).

## Contract Relationships

The relationships between these components are crucial for understanding the overall system architecture:

- HubDAO creates and manages multiple TextDAO instances
- Each TextDAO utilizes the Meta Contract for upgradeability and efficient storage management
- TextDAO instances interact with each other through the HubDAO

For a visual representation and detailed explanation of these relationships, see the [Contract Relationship Diagram](contract-relationship.md).

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Meta Contract (MC)

The Meta Contract is a library that implements the UCS (Upgradeable Clone for Scalable Contracts) architecture. It provides:

- Function-level upgradeability
- Factory/clone-friendly design for efficient deployment
- Shared data structures across multiple functions

1. **Upgradeability**: The use of the UCS architecture allows for function-level upgrades, providing flexibility while maintaining security.

2. **Scalability**: The factory/clone pattern implemented through the Meta Contract enables efficient deployment of multiple TextDAO instances.

3. **Modular Design**: Separating HubDAO and TextDAO functionalities allows for easier maintenance and potential future extensions.

For more information about the Meta Contract, refer to the [Meta Contract Specification](../development/meta-contract-spec.md).

## Future Considerations

As the TextDAO project evolves, the following architectural considerations may be explored:

- Enhanced governance mechanisms and voting systems

## Conclusion

The TextDAO contract architecture provides a robust and flexible foundation for decentralized text management and governance. By leveraging the UCS architecture and maintaining a clear separation of concerns between HubDAO and TextDAO contracts, the system is well-positioned for future growth and adaptability.

For developers working on the TextDAO contracts, it is essential to understand these architectural principles and refer to the specific contract specifications when implementing new features or modifications.
