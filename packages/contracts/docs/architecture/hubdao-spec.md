# HubDAO Specification

This document provides a detailed specification of the HubDAO contract, which serves as the central management contract for the TextDAO ecosystem.

## Overview

The HubDAO contract is responsible for creating, managing, and coordinating multiple TextDAO instances. It acts as a factory and registry for TextDAO contracts, ensuring proper initialization and providing a centralized point of access for global operations.

## Key Features

1. TextDAO Creation
2. Global Configuration Management
3. Upgrade Coordination
4. User Profile Management

## Contract Structure

### Storage

- [Schema.sol](../../src/hubdao/storages/Schema.sol)
- [Storage.sol](../../src/hubdao/storages/Storage.sol)

### Functions

[HubDAOFunctions.sol](../../src/hubdao/interfaces/HubDAOFunctions.sol)

1. [TextDAO Creation](../../src/hubdao/functions/CreateDAO.sol)
    1. User calls `createTextDAO` with a name
    2. HubDAO deploys a new TextDAO contract
    3. New TextDAO instance is stored in the `mapping(address => Dao) daos`

2. Global Configuration Management

3. Upgrade Coordination

4. [ser Profile Management](../../src/hubdao/functions/UserManagement.sol)

### Errors

- [HubDAOErrors.sol](../../src/hubdao/interfaces/HubDAOErrors.sol)

### Events

- [HubDAOEvents.sol](../../src/hubdao/interfaces/HubDAOEvents.sol)

## Access Control

HubDAO implements role-based access control:

- ADMIN_ROLE

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control: Ensure only authorized addresses can create TextDAOs or modify global settings
2. Upgrade Safety: Implement secure upgrade mechanisms for both HubDAO and TextDAO contracts
3. Gas Limitations: Be aware of gas limits when creating new TextDAO instances or updating global configurations

## Future Considerations

## Conclusion

The HubDAO contract serves as the cornerstone of the TextDAO ecosystem, providing essential management and coordination functionality. By centralizing TextDAO creation and global configuration, it ensures consistency and facilitates future upgrades and enhancements to the entire system.
